# End of Semester Reflection

This Git repository was used for assignments and labs in COMP 20 Spring 2016. 

My favorite assignment this semester was Assignment 1: Portfolio. As a fairly visual person, I found it very 
satisfying to get all the formatting working how I picture with just simple CSS and HTML.

I've definitely grown over this course. This course has made me much more conscientious about UX/UI and issues of security.

The most important thing I learned was how to approach getting a new tool to work in an existing project. For instance, I
had to learn a whole new way to debug a program when my map for Landmarks was not rendering. I also found good strategies
for sifting through Stack Overflow posts.

I would like to delve more into the low-level details of security and encryption.
